"""Give the application role a login and a password from the environment.

Migration 0001 creates `garage_pass_app` NOLOGIN NOSUPERUSER NOBYPASSRLS, so
the SCHEMA carries the guarantee that the application cannot bypass row-level
security. This adds the login, and it deliberately does NOT touch the three
attributes that matter: a script that could hand the app role BYPASSRLS would be
a script that could make every isolation test pass for the wrong reason.

    GARAGE_PASS_APP_PASSWORD=... python scripts/ensure-app-role.py "<dsn>"

Run as the database owner. The password is read from the environment and never
from an argument, because arguments are visible in `ps` to every user on the box.
It is put into the statement by ``psycopg.sql`` composition -- quoted as a
literal, never interpolated as a string -- because ``ALTER ROLE`` is a utility
statement and PostgreSQL binds no parameters into those: the first cut passed
the password as a bind parameter and the README's second install step died on
``syntax error at or near "$1"``, and nothing in the tree had ever run the
script. A test now runs it against the test cluster (``tests/test_g10_...``),
and it prints nothing that contains the password.
