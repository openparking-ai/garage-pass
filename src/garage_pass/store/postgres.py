"""Connecting, setting the tenant, and asking the catalogue what is protected.

**THE APPLICATION NEVER CONNECTS AS THE OWNER, AND NEVER AS A SUPERUSER.** A
superuser bypasses row-level security unconditionally; ``FORCE`` does not stop
one, it only closes the table-owner hole. So an isolation test run as the stock
``postgres`` service user sees every tenant's rows whether the policies exist or
not -- it fails on correct code, and the tempting fix is to weaken the assertion.
``assert_role_cannot_bypass_rls`` is run BEFORE any isolation assertion for
exactly that reason: the test proves it is connected as a role that could be
stopped, before it proves it was stopped.

**EVERY COVERAGE CHECK ASKS THE CATALOGUE, NOT A LIST.** ``tables_without_rls``
reads ``pg_class`` and ``pg_policy``; ``garage_references_without_a_composite_key``
reads ``pg_attribute`` and ``pg_constraint``; ``grants_on`` reads
``information_schema``; ``columns_named_like`` reads ``pg_attribute``. A check
that walked a list of table names somebody typed could not notice a table added
without protection, which is the entire failure each exists to catch.

This module imports ``psycopg`` at call time. The engine never imports this
file, so a machine with no driver can still answer an access question.
