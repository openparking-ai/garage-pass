"""The guard that makes a guarantee test a guarantee: it must actually RUN.

Proving a test CAN fail is half of it. A sibling repository in this project
shipped three tests proving
its presence gate was wired that skipped in every CI run for a fortnight, on a
condition nobody watched, while the build stayed green and the file's own header
claimed the opposite. A test that can quietly not run is not a guarantee.

This is that mechanism with the two properties this project forbids elsewhere
taken out of it -- see tests/_guarantees.py. The check is a SET COMPARISON
against the registry, so it catches the case a per-test hook structurally cannot:
a module that fails to import produces no test items at all, and a guard that
only inspects items it was given will never notice the ones it was not.
