"""G10 -- every table carries a tenant column, ENABLE, FORCE and a policy, and
every garage and pass reference is half of a composite tenant key.

**READ FROM THE CATALOGUE, NEVER FROM A LIST OF TABLE NAMES.** A check that
walked a list somebody typed cannot notice a table added without protection,
which is the entire failure it exists to catch.

**AND THE SUPERUSER TRAP IS CHECKED BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE.** A Postgres superuser
bypasses row-level security unconditionally; `FORCE` does not stop one, it only
closes the table-owner hole. So `assert_role_cannot_bypass_rls` runs first: the
test proves it is connected as a role that COULD be stopped, before it proves it
was stopped.

**THE ONE ALLOWANCE IN THE SUITE IS HERE.** There is no way to read a database
catalogue without a database, so these skip when `GARAGE_PASS_TEST_DSN` is
unset. CI always sets it, so CI never skips them -- and `GARAGE_PASS_ALLOW_UNRUN`
is empty in CI, so a run where these did not execute FAILS rather than passing
quietly.

**ISOLATION IS PROVEN ON EVERY TABLE, FROM THE CATALOGUE.** One full graph is
seeded as tenant A through the module -- every table gets a row, and a table
with no row is UNMEASURED, not clean -- then for every table carrying a
tenant column tenant B reads none of A's rows and updates none of them. The
first cut proved isolation on ``garages`` only; a stripped predicate on
``tenants``, ``pass_windows`` or ``pass_lanes`` left the suite green
(measured), and four more tables reddened only by accident.

**THE PUBLISHED INSTALL STEP IS RUN, NOT DESCRIBED.** ``scripts/ensure-app-role.py``
is the README's second step -- it gives the application role its login -- and
it shipped with a bind parameter in an ``ALTER ROLE``, which PostgreSQL's
utility statements cannot take: it died on ``syntax error at or near "$1"``
on first use, because nothing in ``tests/`` or ``.github/`` had ever run it.
That absence was the defect; the test at the end of this file runs the script
against the test cluster, logs in with the password it set, shows a wrong
password refused (the control: the cluster CHECKS passwords, so "it works" is
measured and not assumed), and asserts the password reaches no output.

Controls: FORCE removed from one table in the migration; a composite key
removed from one table in the migration; the policy split into isolated reads
and open writes; the tenant predicate stripped from each table's policy in
turn (the eight of 0001, the ninth of 0002) -- one control per table, each
required to redden this file; the
install script's statement planted back to the bind-parameter form.
